## Task to Do

- Displaying Three Tabs: Create three tabs: "All Orders," "Regular Delivery," and "Express Delivery." These tabs should be displayed next to each other.

- Tab Navigation: When a user clicks on a tab, the corresponding order information should be displayed in a table.

- Pagination: Implement pagination for at least one of the tables. This means displaying a limited number of orders per page and providing navigation options to move between pages.

- Differentiate Selected Tab: The selected tab should be visually differentiated from the other tabs, possibly by using a different color or style.

- Dynamic Data: Use dynamic data for the orders. You can either create your own fake data or use an API to fetch the order information.
